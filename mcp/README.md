## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `upload_markdown` | Upload markdown by `file_path` (preferred for files on disk) or inline `content` |
| `read_document` | Read a document by ID + key, optionally save to `output_path` on disk |
| `update_document` | Update content (edit/admin key) |
| `patch_document` | Find/replace operations without rewriting the full document |
| `generate_link` | Create view/edit/comment link (admin key) |
| `list_links` | List all share links with status (admin key) |
| `revoke_link` | Revoke a share link permanently (admin key) |
| `list_comments` | See all comments and replies |
| `post_comment` | Add a comment, optionally anchored to text |
| `resolve_comment` | Resolve or unresolve a comment |
| `get_versions` | See edit history (who, when) |

## What to say

- "Upload my-notes.md to mdshare and give me an edit link"
- "Save this mdshare document to /tmp/notes.md"
- "Read this mdshare document and summarize the comments"
- "Incorporate the feedback and resolve the comments"
- "Share this markdown with view-only access"
- "Revoke the edit link I shared earlier"
- "List all links for this document"
- "Who edited this document last?"

## Tip: file_path beats inline content

For files already on disk, the tool reads them directly via `file_path` rather than echoing every byte through the conversation. This is dramatically faster for AI workflows because the LLM doesn't need to generate the entire file as a tool-call parameter. Same applies in reverse for downloads via `output_path`.

## Without MCP

Works with any AI chatbot via curl:

```
Read https://mdshare.live/docs/raw to learn the mdshare API,
then upload this markdown and give me a share link.
```
